   *
   * Each system's I/O API can return several error.
   *  Goal is here to map them to common error codes.
   *
   * Note for thread implementation:<br>
   *  Some errors must be handled in specific ways depending on port (serial, USB, TCP, ...).
   *  Each time a error occurs, thread should check the pvRunning flag, and stop if it is false
   *  (typical: after a stop request from main thread, mdtAbstractPort subclass will return
   *    IoProcessCanceled. But it can happen that I/O process was canceled for another reason,
   *    this is port specific).
