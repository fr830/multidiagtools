/*! \brief Base class for a device connected to a port
 *
 * Give some helper methods for event handling, ....
 *
 * If it is needed to continiusly update the representation
 *  of device's inputs (digital/analog I/O, voltage, temperature, ...),
 *  two things can happen:
 *  - 1) Used port can receive data continiusly (f.ex. RS232) and device send data automatically
 *  - 2) Used port need that a request is sent for each read (TCP, USB, ...) or device need such request
 * Continous update is typical usefull for a GUI representing a real device.
 *
 * A other usage is automated sequence. In this case, the sequence will tell when it need
 *  to set a output and when a input value is reuqierd.
 *
 * A device can accept one or many request befor results must be read. This depends most case
 *  on used port and protocol.
 *
 * It can be useful to find on witch port a device is attached (f.ex. setup of a automated test application).
 *
 * A device can have several states (ready, busy, disconnected, ...). To help the application programmer
 *  to keep coherence, this states are updated in this class. (signal, ...)
