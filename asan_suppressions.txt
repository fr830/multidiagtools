# When AddressSanitizer is enabled (which is default in developper build of Mdt),
# some leaks produced by other libraries are reported.
# To avoid these reports, call tests with following command:
# ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=1 LSAN_OPTIONS=suppressions=asan_suppressions.txt path/to/executable
leak:libfontconfig
leak:libc
leak:libX11
