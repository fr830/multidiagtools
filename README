Multi Diag Tools is a library that should help (in some future) interacting with some common instruments.
But, today it's just a set of C++ classes, and nothing is complete.

Multi Diag Tools is based on Qt4, but some part of code is platform dependend.

Install

On Debian based system, packages should be available,
but these are not complete (probably are dependencies missing)

For Windows, a installer is provided (generated by NSIS)

To build the libraries, tools, ... from sources, some tools are needed:
 - CMake: http://www.cmake.org/
 - Qt4: http://qt.nokia.com/products/
 - g++
 - make
 - ...

Linux
All dependencies should be avaliable in standard package manager.

Windows

CMake:
Download it from http://www.cmake.org/
Install it in default location (Program Files), this will simplify the build later.

MinGW:
Download it from http://www.mingw.org/
Install it in default location (C:\), this will simplify the build later.
Note: have some trouble (direct crash) with latest update with gcc 4.7.0 !

Qt4
Web: http://qt.nokia.com
Download the library for MinGW: http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/windows-cpp
Again, this will simplify next steps.
Note: don't know wat is today, but the Qt SDK contained no binary (2011),
and compilation needed approx 5h.
With Qt libraries 4.8.1 for Windows (minGW) , no build is needed.

NSIS
Downlad from here : http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Download
And install it with default location.

BUILD

On linux:
./configure.sh
make
cpack .
sudo dpkg-i *.deb

On Windows, in a cmd terminal:
configure.bat
make  (or mingw32-make)
cpack .
Call the .exe installer to install

Note that configure.bat creates a PATH, so that CMake, mingw, Qt libs and tools are found.
Bad thing is that paths are written manually, so if you have, for example, Qt 4.7, configure.bat must be edited..
