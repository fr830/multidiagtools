/*! \brief MODBUS hardware node ID
   *
   * The concept of node ID is specific to MultiDiagTools.
   *  It was introduced to solve the problem of network IP configurations.
   *
   * Take a example: We have a application that needs several MODBUS/TCP nodes.
   *  Each node has several I/O's.
   *  Say that digital output 1 of node 1 is used to activate a lamp
   *  and output 1 of node 2 must activate heating register.
   *  We could choose to have static IP addresses in the network and configure the
   *  application to activate the correct output of correct node.
   *  But, this can be a problem when a node must be replaced.
   *  More cumbersome case is a modular application that could manage several nodes,
   *  and change his I/Os layout in a dynamic way regarding a context.
   *
   * A easy way to solve such problems is to have a DHCP server in the network and
   *  all nodes configured as DHCP clients
   *   (static addressing can still be a solution, but we not depend on it).
   *  Then, for a given application, we can fix a number of digital inputs to play
   *  the role of node ID. Then, instead of using IP address as identification
   *  (as in the example), we use node ID.
